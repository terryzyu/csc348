# CSC348: Intro to Compiler Design

### Course Description ###
An overview of the design of a compiler for a general purpose programming language; tools for designing the components of the compiler; implementing the compiler; run time environments.

### Tools Used ###

* Eclipse
* Ant
* Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

### Notes ###
There are two folders: minijava_starter and testEnv. minijava_starter contains my work from start to finish. testEnv contains professor's solutions that were published after each homework assignment. I decided to keep both here because there are multiple ways to solve this problem and you'll notice that my solution may not be compatible with the professor's if you simply copy paste snippets of code. You will also find a mess of .sh files which are simply scripts to automate the process of cleaning, building, and analyzing results quickly. The titles of the scripts should be self explanatory if you were taking this course.
